This repository contains every programming exercises of a Chinese math textbook ["Numerical Linear Algebra"](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%95%B0%E5%80%BC%E7%BA%BF%E6%80%A7%E4%BB%A3%E6%95%B0%EF%BC%88%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89/18777339)

This is my homework for Numerical Algebra at USTC in the fall 2020 semester. Since it is recovered from my previous backup files, there might be some encoding issues as all comments were written in Chinese. A more standard update will come later.

- C1: Gaussian elimination method and square root methods
- C2: Estimate of 1-norm of matrix with optimization
- C3: QR decomposition and LLS (linear least square problem)
- C4: Iterative methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR) for ODEs and PDEs
- C5: Conjugate gradient method, compared with iterative methods
- C6: Power method and implicit QR algorithm
- C7: Jacobiâ€™s threshold method and bisection method 
- SVD: SVD decompostion algorithm
